This is an implementation of web microservice architecture that provides system to oranise the real-life game "Killer".
It contains a main node - web-service that implements logic of the app (mainframe) and a bunch of small web-applications (terminals) that interact with social media API or web-interface and pass information to the main node via established HTTP API.
Finished: MVP of a central node
In the near future: extension of the main node capabilities, implementation of some terminals, attachment of additional technologies
